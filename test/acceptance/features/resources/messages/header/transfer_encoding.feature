Feature: Transfer-Encoding general-header field
    In order to ignore transfer-encoding requests 
    As a exchange developer
    I want to return a normal status for the Transfer-Encoding general-header field.

    Scenario Outline: Presense of transfer-encoding general-header field with content-length.
        Given I have started a message exchange
        And I perform a HTTP "POST" request to "/queues" with headers "Content-Type: application/json, Accept: application/json, Host: localhost:1984":
        """
        " { "data": {                                        "

        And I perform a HTTP "POST" request to "/subscriptions" with headers "Content-Type: application/json, Accept: application/json, Host: localhost:1984":

        Then I should see a response status code of "202" "Accepted"
