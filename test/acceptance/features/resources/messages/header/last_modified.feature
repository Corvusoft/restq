Feature: Last-Modified entity-header field
    In order to identify the last alteration made to a collection
    As a collection owner
    I want a collection that returns the Last-Modified entity-header field

    Scenario Outline: Create resource.
        Given I have started a message exchange
        And I perform a HTTP "POST" request to "/queues" with headers "Content-Type: application/json, Accept: application/json, Host: localhost:1984":
        """
        " { "data": {                                        "
