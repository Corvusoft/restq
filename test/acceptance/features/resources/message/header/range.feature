Feature: Range request-header field
    In order to indicate that particular server behaviors are not supported
    As a exchange developer
    I want a colection that responds correctly to the Range request-header field

    Scenario Outline: Valid range value.
        Given I have started a message exchange
        And I perform a HTTP "POST" request to "/queues" with headers "Content-Type: application/json, Accept: application/json, Host: localhost:1984":
