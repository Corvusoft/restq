Feature: HTTP HEAD
    In order to restrict the HTTP methods available
    As a collection owner
    I want to disallow the HTTP HEAD method

    Scenario Outline: Read resource meta-data.
        Given I have started a message exchange
        And I perform a HTTP "POST" request to "/messages" with headers "Content-Type: text/plain, Accept: application/json, Host: localhost:1984":
        """
        " User logged-in."
        """
        When I perform a HTTP "HEAD" request to the last response "Location" header value with headers "Accept: application/json, Host: localhost:1984"
        Then I should see a response status code of "405" "Method Not Allowed"
        And I should see a "Server" header value "corvusoft/restq"
        And I should see a "Content-Type" header value "application/json; charset=utf-8"
