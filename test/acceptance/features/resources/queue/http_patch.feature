Feature: HTTP PATCH
    In order to restrict the HTTP methods available
    As a resource owner
    I want to disallow the HTTP PATCH method

    Scenario Outline: Patch resource.
        Given I have started a message exchange
        And I perform a HTTP "POST" request to "/queues" with headers "Content-Type: application/json, Accept: application/json, Host: localhost:1984":
        """
        " { "data": {                                        "
        "     "key": "1763be65-7471-447b-a6a4-40a00ef7dfb0", "
        "     "name": "acceptance-test"                      "
        "   }                                                "
