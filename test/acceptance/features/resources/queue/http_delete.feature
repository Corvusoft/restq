Feature: HTTP DELETE
    In order to remove a resource
    As a resource owner
    I want to allow the HTTP DELETE method

    Scenario Outline: Delete resource.
        Given I have started a message exchange
        And I perform a HTTP "POST" request to "/queues" with headers "Content-Type: application/json, Accept: application/json, Host: localhost:1984":
        """
