Feature: Upgrade general-header field
    In order to ignore upgrade requests 
    As a exchange developer
    I want to return a normal status for Upgrade general-header fields.

    Scenario Outline: Upgrade general-header field.
        Given I have started a message exchange
        And I perform a HTTP "POST" request to "/queues" with headers "Content-Type: application/json, Accept: application/json, Host: localhost:1984":
        """
        " { "data": {                                        "
        "     "key": "a46ab5ff-747c-4da8-94dd-f184578a9160", "
        "     "name": "acceptance-test"                      "
        "   }                                                "
        " }                                                  "
        """
        When I perform a HTTP "HEAD" request to "/queues/a46ab5ff-747c-4da8-94dd-f184578a9160" with headers "Accept: application/json, Host: localhost:1984, Connection: upgrade, Upgrade: h2c"
        Then I should see a response status code of "204" "No Content"
        And I should see a "Server" header value "corvusoft/restq"
