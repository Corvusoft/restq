Feature: If-Match request-header field
    In order to ignore conditional requests 
    As a exchange developer
    I want to return a normal status for the If-Match request-header field

    Scenario Outline: ETag if-match request-header field.
        Given I have started a message exchange
        And I perform a HTTP "POST" request to "/queues" with headers "Content-Type: application/json, Accept: application/json, Host: localhost:1984":
