Feature: HTTP HEAD
    In order to retrieve resource meta-data
    As a resource owner
    I want to allow the HTTP HEAD method

    Scenario Outline: Read resource meta-data.
        Given I have started a message exchange
        And I perform a HTTP "POST" request to "/subscriptions" with headers "Content-Type: application/json, Accept: application/json, Host: localhost:1984":
        """
        " { "data": {                                        "
        "     "key": "1177aed8-a024-445f-8560-dc0b478c04e9", "
        "     "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080"            "
        "   }                                                "
        " }                                                  "

        Then I should see a response status code of "204" "No Content"
