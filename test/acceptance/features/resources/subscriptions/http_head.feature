Feature: HTTP HEAD
    In order to retrieve collection meta-data
    As a collection owner
    I want to allow the HTTP HEAD method

    Scenario Outline: Read collection meta-data with single entry.
        Given I have started a message exchange
        And I perform a HTTP "POST" request to "/subscriptions" with headers "Content-Type: application/json, Accept: application/json, Host: localhost:1984":
        """
        " { "data": {                                        "
        "     "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080"            "
        "   }                                                "
        " }                                                  "
        """
        When I perform a HTTP "HEAD" request to "/subscriptions" with headers "Accept: application/json, Host: localhost:1984"
        Then I should see a response status code of "204" "No Content"
