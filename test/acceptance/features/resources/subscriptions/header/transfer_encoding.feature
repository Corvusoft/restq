Feature: Transfer-Encoding general-header field
    In order to ignore transfer-encoding requests 
    As a exchange developer
    I want to return a normal status for the Transfer-Encoding general-header field.

    Scenario Outline: Presense of transfer-encoding general-header field with content-length.
        Given I have started a message exchange
        When I perform a HTTP "POST" request to "/subscriptions" with headers "Content-Type: application/json, Accept: application/json, Host: localhost:1984, Content-Length: 124, Transfer-Encoding: chunked":
        """
        " { "data": {                   "
        "     "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080" "
        "   }                           "
        " }                             "
        """
        Then I should see a response status code of "201" "Created"
