Feature: Upgrade general-header field
    In order to ignore upgrade requests 
    As a exchange developer
    I want to return a normal status for Upgrade general-header fields.

    Scenario Outline: Upgrade general-header field.
        Given I have started a message exchange
        When I perform a HTTP "POST" request to "/subscriptions" with headers "Content-Type: application/json, Accept: application/json, Host: localhost:1984, Connection: upgrade, Upgrade: h2c":
        """
        " { "data": {                                        "
        "     "key": "a46ab5ff-747c-4da8-94dd-f184578a9160", "
        "     "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080"            "
        "   }                                                "
        " }                                                  "
        """
        Then I should see a response status code of "201" "Created"
        And I should see a "Server" header value "corvusoft/restq"
        And I should see a "Content-Type" header value "application/json; charset=utf-8"

        And I should see a "Vary" header value "Accept,Accept-Encoding,Accept-Charset,Accept-Language"
        And I should see a "Accept-Ranges" header value "none"
        And I should see a "Allow" header value "GET,PUT,HEAD,DELETE,OPTIONS"
        And I should see a "Location" header value
        And I should not see a "WWW-Authenticate" header value
        And I should not see a "Trailer" header value
        And I should not see a "Warning" header value
        And I should not see a "Content-Range" header value
        And I should not see a "Content-Encoding" header value
        And I should not see a "Content-Language" header value
        And I should not see a "Content-Location" header value
        And I should not see a "Retry-After" header value
        And I should not see a "Age" header value
        And I should not see a "Via" header value
        And I should not see a "Upgrade" header value
        And I should not see a "Transfer-Encoding" header value
        And I should not see a "Proxy-Authentication" header value
        And I should see a response body describing the resource:
