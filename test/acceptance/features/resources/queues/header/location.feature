Feature: Location response-header field
    In order to inform a recipient of the identification of a new resource
    As a collection owner
    I want the Location response-header returned for newly created resources

    Scenario Outline: Create single resource.
        Given I have started a message exchange
        When I perform a HTTP "POST" request to "/queues" with headers "Content-Type: application/json, Accept: application/json, Host: localhost:1984":
        """
        " { "data": {                                        "
