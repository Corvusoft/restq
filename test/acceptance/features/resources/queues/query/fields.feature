Feature: Fields Query
    In order to reduce network load
    As a collection consumer
    I want the ability extract specific fields from an entity

    Scenario Outline: Read selected fields.
        Given I have started a message exchange
        And I perform a HTTP "POST" request to "/queues" with headers "Content-Type: application/json, Accept: application/json, Host: localhost:1984":
